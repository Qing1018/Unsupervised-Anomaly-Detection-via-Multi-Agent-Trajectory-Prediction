### Abstract

This work addresses the challenge of data scarcity in safety-critical traffic scenarios by proposing an unsupervised anomaly detection framework. Traditional methods often rely on expensive manual labeling or predefined rule sets, which struggle to capture rare and complex interaction failures.

**Key Contributions:**
* **Multi-Agent Transformer:** We developed a long-horizon, interaction-aware trajectory prediction model to capture complex agent dynamics.
* **Unsupervised Pipeline:** By integrating structured prediction errors, Isolation Forest, and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), we enable robust anomaly detection without ground-truth anomaly labels.
* **Real-World Validation:** Using NGSIM Dataset, we identified **2,832 anomalies** (including **388 novel high-risk cases**) and distilled them into four interpretable scenario families.
* **Adversarial Generation:** The framework supports generating realistic adversarial scenarios to stress-test Autonomous Vehicle (AV) planning algorithms.
